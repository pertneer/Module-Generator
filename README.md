phpBB3 Module Generator
-------------------

When completed this will create an ACP Module, MCP Module, or a UCP Module. These item are named, in proper folders, and include the necessary header information and layout to be included into a modification using the information you provide as a starting point. 

Although you will need to add all of you needed code for your modification after it is generated.

**Note:** This is still very rough and not functioning at this point.

I used the [MODx creator offline](https://github.com/phpbb/modx_creator_offline) as a starting point, so credit for this code goes to the [phpBB group](https://www.phpbb.com/)
